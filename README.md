# Kirb3 Minecraft-Auto-Fisher Remake.
This is a sort of a remake of Kirb3's Minecraft Auto Fisher.                                                 
I take NO CREDIT for this idea, it's Kirb3's. Original - https://github.com/kirb3/minecraft-fisher                                    
The point of this program is to make Kirb3's idea a little more elegent and accurate.                              
This is my first git use ever, so be a little kind :)

Usage:                                                                        
-Start up you minecraft world and throw a fishing line into a body of water.                    
-Run the program.                                                       
-Make a rectangle by dragging your mouse from the top left corner to the bottom right corner.                                             
-Unpause the game and let the program fish for you!                                                       
*Important - Do not move your minecraft cursor while the program is running.
